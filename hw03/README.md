## A bit of background

I have a strong mathematics background. I have my BA and MS in Mathematics from Eastern Washington University. I have been in teaching for about 15yrs. the last five i have taught Interactive Media in corrections. This consisted of Photoshop, Illustrator, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Flash, Premiere, and Dreamweaver. The IAM program was eliminated statewide. So I decided to try my hand at coding again.

I wanted to sign up for the Ruby class. But it too was eliminated. So I chose Python instead. The first week of class has gone as expected.  Python is not what is difficult. What is difficult has been:

- Finding a laptop to dual boot Linux

- Installing Linux (Wireless driver issues)

- Installing programs on Linux

- Using programs on Linux

- Git is good. [GitHub](www.GitHub.com) I don't get.

In short, learning Linux in less than a week is tough.
